# Logo Instructions

## Add Your Logo

Place your logo file as:

- **Path**: `public/assets/images/logo.png`
- **Format**: PNG (recommended for transparency) or JPG
- **Recommended Size**: 100x100px to 200x200px
- **Background**: Transparent (PNG) or white background

## Current Logo Path

The header is configured to display: `/assets/images/logo.png`

## If You Don't Have a Logo Yet

The site will work fine, but the logo image will show as broken until you add one.

### Temporary Solution

You can create a simple text-only version by editing the Header component to hide the logo image.

### Where to Get a Logo

- Design your own using Canva, Adobe Illustrator, or similar tools
- Hire a designer on Fiverr or Upwork
- Use AI tools like DALL-E or Midjourney
- Commission a custom logo from a graphic designer

## Logo Design Tips

- Keep it simple and recognizable
- Use colors that match your brand (browns, golds from the site theme)
- Should work at small sizes (navbar) and large sizes
- Consider art-related elements: paintbrush, palette, mandala patterns
